Playing Down by Osama Hussein 

 

Drop it low down first 

Imma let you in, on a little secret 

When you play down, especially in life 

You might feel like a total dork 

But I promise you 

It’ll all be worth it 

Let me give reasons why you should play down 

Playing down gives you confidence 

Playing down improves your resiliency 

Playing down shows your true character 

Because if you don’t play down 

How will you win in life? 

Winning in life takes more than just winning 

It takes failure 

It takes being punched 

It takes losing 

It takes pain 

It takes suffering 

I could go on and on 

Until you finally start feeling like you can truly win at anything 

Even the losers become winners overnight just by playing down 

If you think you’re a loser 

Well don’t 

Because you aren’t a loser for playing down 

Only if you play down to your competition 

You’ll look like a loser 

If you don’t want to be a loser 

Then, play down 

Give yourself challenges and obstacles until you know how to come back 

How to get back up 

And dominate this life 

Because in life, you don’t dominate by playing up 

Playing up doesn’t mean you’re tough 

Playing up doesn’t make a winner 

Playing up doesn’t give you everything you want in life 

Because in life, you start dominating by playing down 

Playing down doesn’t mean you aren’t tough 

Playing down doesn’t mean you’re a loser 

Playing down doesn’t punish you from being great 

Because you can still be great 

Take it from Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant 

Some of the all-time greats 

They never play when they’re up 

They always play down until they start winning consistently 

How does the saying go? 

Everybody’s acting tough when they play up 

No, everyone is tough when they play down 

Yeah, you heard that right 

Me? I don’t play down to my competition 

I play down to myself because I know I can win in life 

With anything 

With satisfaction 

And with gratitude 

You ain’t no winner if you’ve never lost before 

Everyone loses 

Everyone should play down 

And never be afraid to crawl back up to success 

It isn’t about how you start 

It’s all about how you finish
